* ~bic~: A C interpreter and API explorer

  [[https://travis-ci.org/hexagonal-sun/bic][https://travis-ci.org/hexagonal-sun/bic.svg?branch=master]]

  This a project that allows developers to explore and test C-APIs using a read
  eval print loop, also known as a REPL.

** Dependencies
   BIC's run-time dependencies are as follows:
   - [[https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html][GNU Readline]]
   - [[https://gmplib.org/][GNU MP]]

   To build BIC, you'll need:
   - [[https://github.com/westes/flex][Flex]]
   - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/][GNU Bison]]
   - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/][GNU Automake]]
   - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/][GNU M4]]
   - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/][GNU Autoconf Archive]]

   Please ensure you have these installed before building bic. The following
   command should install these on a Debian/Ubuntu system:

   #+begin_example
apt-get install build-essential libreadline-dev autoconf-archive libgmp-dev expect flex bison automake m4 libtool pkg-config
   #+end_example

** Installation
   You can compile and install bic with the following commands:

#+begin_example
autoreconf -i
./configure --enable-debug
make
make install
#+end_example

*** Docker
    You can use docker to build and run bic with the following command:

#+begin_example
docker build -t bic https://github.com/hexagonal-sun/bic.git#master
#+end_example

    Once the image is build you can then run bic with:
#+begin_example
docker run -i bic
#+end_example

*** Arch Linux
    If you are using Arch Linux, you can install bic from AUR:

#+begin_example
yay -S bic
#+end_example

** Usage
*** REPL
    When invoking bic with no arguments the user is presented with a REPL prompt:

    #+begin_example
BIC>
    #+end_example

    Here you can type C statements and =#include= various system headers to
    provide access to different APIs on the system. One thing to note is that
    statements can be entered directly into the REPL; there is no need to define
    a function for them to be evaluated. Say we wish to execute the following C
    program:

    #+begin_src C
 #include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    FILE *f = fopen("out.txt", "w");
    fputs("Hello, world!\n", f);
    return 0;
}
    #+end_src

    We can do this on the REPL with BIC using the following commands:

    #+begin_example
BIC> #include <stdio.h>
BIC> FILE *f;
f
BIC> f = fopen("test.txt", "w");
BIC> fputs("Hello, World!\n", f);
1
BIC>
    #+end_example

    This will cause bic to call out to the C-library =fopen()= and =fputs()=
    functions to create a file and write the hello world string into it. If you
    now exit bic, you should see a file ~test.txt~ in the current working
    directory with the string ~Hello, World\n~ contained within it.

    Notice that after evaluating an expression bic will print the result of
    evaluation. This can be useful for testing out simple expressions:

    #+begin_example
BIC> 2 * 8 + fileno(f);
19
    #+end_example

**** The Inspector

     You can use bic to obtain information about any variable or type that has
     been declared by prefixing it's name with a ~?~. This special syntax only
     works on a REPL but will allow you to obtain various characteristics about
     types and variables. For example:

     #+begin_example
BIC> #include <stdio.h>
BIC> ?stdout
stdout is a pointer to a struct _IO_FILE.
value of stdout is 0x7ff1325bc5c0.
sizeof(stdout) = 8 bytes.
stdout was declared at: /usr/include/stdio.h:138.
     #+end_example

*** Evaluating Files
    If you pass bic a source file as a command line argument it will evaluate
    it, by calling a =main()= function. For example, suppose we have the file
    ~test.c~ that contains the following:

    #+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int factorial(int n)
{
  if (!n)
  {
    return 1;
  }

  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main()
{
  printf("Factorial of 4 is: %d\n", factorial(4));

  return 0;
}
    #+end_src

    We can then invoke bic with ~test.c~ as a parameter to evaluate it:

    [[file:doc/img/eval-file.gif]]

    You can also use a special expression: =<REPL>;= in your source code to make
    bic drop you into the repl at a particular point in the file evaluation:

    [[file:doc/img/repl-interrupt.gif]]

*** Exploring external libraries with the REPL

    You can use bic to explore the APIs of other libraries other than libc. Let's
    suppose we wish to explore the [[https://github.com/aquynh/capstone][Capstone]] library, we pass in a ~-l~ option to
    make bic load that library when it starts.  For example:

    [[file:doc/img/capstone.gif]]

    Notice that when bic prints a compound data type (a =struct= or a =union=),
    it shows all member names and their corresponding values.


** Implementation Overview

*** Tree Objects
    At the heart of bic's implementation is the =tree= object. These are generic
    objects that can be used to represent an entire program as well as the
    current evaluator state. It is implemented in ~tree.h~ and ~tree.c~. Each
    tree type is defined in ~c.lang~. The ~c.lang~ file is a lisp-like
    specification of:

    - Object name, for example =T_ADD=.
    - A human readable name, such as ~Addition~.
    - A property name prefix, such as ~tADD~.
    - A list of properties for this type, such as ~LHS~ and ~RHS~.

    The code to create an object with the above set of attributes would be:

    #+begin_src lisp
(deftype T_ADD "Addition" "tADD"
         ("LHS" "RHS"))
    #+end_src

    Once defined, we can use this object in our C code in the following way:

    #+begin_src C
tree make_increment(tree number)
{
    tree add = tree_make(T_ADD);

    tADD_LHS(add) = number;
    tADD_RHS(add) = tree_make_const_int(1);

    return add;
}
    #+end_src

    Notice that a set of accessor macros, =tADD_LHS()= and =tADD_RHS()=, have
    been generated for us to access the different property slots. When
    ~--enable-debug~ is set during compilation each one of these macros expands
    to a check to ensure that when setting the =tADD_LHS= property of an object
    that the object is indeed an instance of a =T_ADD=.

    The ~c.lang~ file is read by numerous source-to-source compilers that
    generate code snippets. These utilities include:

    - ~gentype~: Generates a list of tree object types.
    - ~gentree~: Generates a structure that contains all the property data for
      tree objects.
    - ~genctypes~: Generates a list of C-Type tree objects - these represent the
      fundamental data types in C.
    - ~genaccess~: Generate accessor macros for tree object properties.
    - ~gengc~: Generate a mark function for each tree object, this allows the
      garbage collector to traverse object trees.
    - ~gendump~: Generate code to dump out tree objects recursively.

*** Evaluator

    The output of the lexer & parser is a =tree= object hierarchy which is then
    passed into the evaluator (~evaluator.c~). The evaluator will then
    recursively evaluate each tree element, updating internal evaluator state,
    thereby executing a program.

    Calls to functions external to the evaluator are handled in a
    platform-dependent way. Currently x86_64 and aarch64 are the only supported
    platforms and the code to handle this is in the ~x86_64~ and ~aarch64~
    folders respectively. This works by taking a function call =tree= object
    (represented by a =T_FN_CALL=) from the evaluator with all arguments
    evaluated and marshalling them into a simple linked-list. This is then
    traversed in assembly to move the value into the correct register according
    to the x86_64 or aarch64 calling-conventions and then branching to the
    function address.

*** Parser & Lexer
    The parser and lexer are implemented in ~parser.m4~ and ~lex.m4~
    respectively. After passing through M4 the output is two bison parsers and
    two flex lexers.

    The reason for two parsers is that the grammar for a C REPL is very
    different than that of a C file. For example, we want the user to be able to
    type in statements to be evaluated on the REPL without the need for wrapping
    them in a function. Unfortunately writing a statement that is outside a
    function body isn't valid C. As such, we don't want the user to be able to
    write bare statements in a C file. To achieve this we have two different set
    of grammar rules which produces two parsers. Most of the grammar rules do
    overlap and therefore we use a single M4 file to take care of the
    differences.
